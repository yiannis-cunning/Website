        <h1>Opperating Environment of Instructions</h1>
            When instructions are executing there is a implicit environment they are being executed in. The same instuction will have 
            differnt effects based on the current mode the cpu is in, where in memeory is the code being executed, what 'segment' of 
            memeory the code in being executed in.

            The main differnce these different modes/segments can cause is defualt opperand size and defualt address size. For example 
            MOV register1 0x55, could mean move 0x55 to EAX if defualt opperand size is 32-bits and could mean move 0x55 to AL if the 
            defualt opperand size is 8-bits. Similarily MOV [register1] 0x55 might use 
            <br>    
            defualt opperand size can be either 32 or 16 bits and the effective opperand size can be 31,16,low-8, high-8
